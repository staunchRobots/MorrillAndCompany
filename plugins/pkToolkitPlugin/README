=pkToolkitPlugin=

pkToolkitPlugin is a collection of useful classes implementing common
routines and algorithms we otherwise find ourselves reinventing in
nearly every application. 

The golden rules for inclusion in pkToolkitPlugin
are simple: it should be something that PHP and/or Symfony should have had 
in the first place, and the implementation shouldn't be hugely complicated 
or have major dependencies on other libraries not typically built 
into PHP 5.2.x unless the feature (such as Zend Search) is overwhelmingly
useful in the majority of projects. In cases such as Zend Search, it 
is still possible to use all of the non-search-related features of pkToolkit
without the need for the Zend library. 

pkToolkitPlugin classes generally contain straightforward static public
methods. They are grouped in classes in order to gain the benefits of 
autoloading and keep the PHP namespace uncluttered.

pkToolkitPlugin also contains a collection of jQuery-based JavaScript
progressive enhancement functions in its web/js folder. For more information 
about progressive enhancement in general, see 
[this alistapart article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement).

Since these are not loaded unless you expressly bring them in, there is no 
significant overhead for those not using them. 

For the time being, see the comments in the code for documentation.
